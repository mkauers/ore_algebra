        Test if it is time to halt the computation of the sum of a series.

        INPUT:

        - cb: BoundCallbacks object, see the documentation of that class;
        - sing: boolean, True signals a singular index where we should return
          infinity without even trying to compute a better bound (this is useful
          to avoid special-casing singular indices elsewhere);
        - n: current index;
        - ini_tb: previous tail bound (can be infinite);
        - est: real interval, heuristic estimate of the absolute value of the
          tail of the series, **whose lower bound must tend to zero or
          eventually become negative**, and whose width can be used to provide
          an indication of interval blow-up in the computation; typically
          something like abs(first nonzero neglected term);
        - next_stride: indication of how many additional terms the caller
          intends to sum before calling us again.

        OUTPUT:

        (done, bound) where done is a boolean indicating if it is time to stop
        the computation, and bound is a rigorous (possibly infinite) bound on
        the tail of the series.
